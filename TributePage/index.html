	  <li>Typical video subjects included demonstrations of how mechanical objects work, such as bulldozers, or how they are manufactured, such as crayons</li>
	  <li>Each episode included a trip to Rogers' "Neighborhood of Make-Believe" featuring a trolley with its own chiming theme song, a castle, and the kingdom's citizens, including King Friday XIII.</li>
	  <li>Mister Rogers often fed his fish during episodes.</li>
	  <li>Originally, most episodes ended with a song entitled "Tomorrow", and Friday episodes looked forward to the week ahead with an adapted version of "It's Such a Good Feeling". In later seasons, all episodes ended with "Feeling".</li>
	  <li>Visually, the presentation of the show was very simple, and it did not feature the animation or fast pace of other children's shows, which Rogers thought of as "bombardment".</li>
	</ul>
